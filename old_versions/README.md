These files represent various versions of the [previous implementation](https://github.com/IvetBx/MHS-MXP-algorithm). The previous work examined various possible optimization which may make the MHS-MXP algorithm more effective and faster. In the end, none of the versions brought significant improvement over MHS-MXP. More information about the optimizations and versions would be found directly in the work [*Heuristic optimization of the MHS-MXP
algorithm*](https://opac.crzp.sk/?fn=detailBiblioForm&sid=A8C5898CD77493B3E2F83F491516).
